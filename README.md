# Telecommunicatoin-Company

## Description
**The telecommunication company project serves as a practical undertaking for the Software Engineering (1) course. Our team documented the functional and non-functional requirements, as well as the program's scenario. To provide a comprehensive representation, we employed various diagrams such as Data Flow Diagrams (DFD), Use Case diagrams, Class diagrams, Activity diagrams, and Sequence diagrams. Additionally, we incorporated simplistic interfaces to visually illustrate our application design.**
